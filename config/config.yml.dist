# Image URL
#   You can reference a local file (stored in your theme, for example) like so:
#   image_url: /public/theme/myTheme/assets/images/login-background.jpg
#
# OR
#   reference a file somewhere out on the Internet.
#   (I recommend Unsplash, but that's just me.)
#
#   Use the source.unsplash.com API to pull a random image
#   or a weekly image by search term, etc.
